# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction

This project aims at analyzing a dataset regarding **Telco Customer Churn Information** and, most importantly, finding the best machine learnning model (classification model) to make the most accurate **predictions on whether or not a customer will churn**.

Project Co-Created by: Flora Wong (Yuen Ling), Kun Bi, Naudeen Stewart

Dataset:  [dataset](churn.xlsx) 

More information from: [here](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113).

Dataset contains information from a fictional telco company that provided home phone and internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. 

It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service. Multiple important demographics are included for each customer, as well as a Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index.
